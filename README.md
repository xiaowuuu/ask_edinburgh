Ask_Edinburgh is a web app generates information about Edinburgh using the ChatGPT API, assisting users in asking questions about Edinburgh, particularly in anticipation of the upcoming summer season! The idea came from sometimes when I don't know where to go/what to do during the weekend, so I built this wee trip planner. The project is built with Typescript and React framework as frontend, and Node.js with Express and MongoDB as the backend. Additionally, I gained experience in using the ChatGPT API, implementing Tailwind CSS for styling, and designing with Figma. 

How to use in your device?
<br />Clone the project
<br />npm i
<br />cd client -- npm run dev
<br />cd server -- npm run
<br />you need to create env file and your ChatPGT api key
