Ask_Edinburgh is a web app generates information about Edinburgh using the ChatGPT API, assisting users in asking questions about Edinburgh, particularly in anticipation of the upcoming summer season! The project is built with Typescript and React framework as frontend, and Node.js with Express and MongoDB as the backend. Additionally, I gained experience in using the ChatGPT API, implementing Tailwind CSS for styling, and designing with Figma.
